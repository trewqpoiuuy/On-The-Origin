Weather pseudo code
Need to add or adapt chlorophyll into nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus,
Sunny: generates more N, K, and Ph which makes the plant grow, decreases water
Cloudy: neutral, does not give or take water or pseudophill
Rainy: generates more water, decreases pseudophill 


PLANT RESOURCE METER: 1- max possible amount(rand interger)
-	To little resources plant dies 
-	Low resources, plant grows slower 
-	Medium resources, plant grows at normal rate 
-	High resources, plant grows faster 
-	To much resources plant dies  

[ to little| low| medium| high| to much]  

Random plant generator starts plants with a random medium level of resources
Plants with more even levels will thrive more
Plants that require tons of water and little sunlight will be harder to keep alive
