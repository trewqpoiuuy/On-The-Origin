I included 2 things here:
1. The straight .cpp file that I have been working in.
2. The eclipse project (the folder) that the .cpp file came from.
I doubt that any of you will find use for the eclipse project in it's entirity.

The purpose of each function is explained in the form of comments.

My next goal at the time of my writing this is to turn this into a library. 

Bugs:
For some reason, this program (when executed) returns the same values every time, despite using (supposedly) random coordinates and strings.
